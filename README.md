# ðŸ’» Pre Requestees

To setup our lab we need to have some sort of pre requirements. If you are planning to setup this lab on your own computer you must at least have 16GB of RAM and 100GB of disk space.

In this demo I will setup entire lab on my laptop. If you are using an Apple silicon you can use cloud option other wise you will be face some difficulties.

For the windows 10 VM we have to download and install the windows **Sysmon.**

Also we need to have to download the Sysmon config file from the GitHub.

Install the Sysmon in the windows 10 VM along with the configuration file which has downloaded above.

```powershell
.\Sysmon64.exe -i .\sysmonconfig.xml
```

After installing the Sysmon, you can check Sysmon under the windows event log.

Event Viewer -> Application and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> Sysmon
